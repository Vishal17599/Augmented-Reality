# Augmented-Reality

My First venture into Augmented Reality using aFrame by Mozilla.  
A standard express server code hosts the website which is live on heroku - [https://happy-birthday-shivansh.herokuapp.com](https://happy-birthday-shivansh.herokuapp.com).

#### Note :
This was basically a present for my cousin's birthday, so everything was a bit themed.

### Feature
- The website opens up the camera. All you have to do is scan this on the standard [HIRO marker](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/data/images/HIRO.jpg).
- Once the camera recognises this marker image, all the html code within the a-scene tag's a-marker tag executes.
- 3D OBJ models of cake displays adjacent to main marker.
- Text displaying 'Happy Birthday'
- Image can be displayed which appears curved in the 3D space
- Star rain from both the directions of red and yellow flakes.
